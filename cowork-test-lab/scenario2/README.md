# Scenario 2: Messy Inputs → Executive-Ready Outputs

**Test Cowork's ability to transform rough inputs into polished deliverables.**

---

## What You're Testing

| Capability | Question |
|------------|----------|
| Artifact Awareness | Does it understand reports, slides, and spreadsheets need different formats? |
| Formula Generation | Are Excel formulas correct and usable, not just text? |
| Abstraction Level | Does it summarize appropriately for executives vs. include detail where needed? |

---

## Examples

| Folder | Task | Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| [scenario2-messy-to-polished](./scenario2-messy-to-polished/) | Raw notes + data → Report, Slides, Spreadsheet | 3 files | 3 deliverables |

---

## The Insight

> "The strength here isn't generation — it's artifact awareness. Cowork understands that a spreadsheet, slide, and report each encode decisions differently."
