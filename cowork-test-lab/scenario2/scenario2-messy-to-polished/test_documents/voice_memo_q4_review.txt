Voice Memo - Q4 Review Thoughts
Recorded: Jan 12, 2025

Ok so Q4 was actually pretty good... revenue hit $2.4M which is like 18% above target. The sales team crushed it in December especially.

Um, the new enterprise deals — we closed Acme Corp finally, that's $500K ARR. And TechStart came in at $180K. Those two alone made the quarter.

Customer churn is still a problem though. We lost 12 accounts, mostly smaller ones but still. Sarah thinks it's the onboarding — people don't understand the product in the first 30 days and give up.

What else... hiring is behind. We wanted 5 engineers by year end, only got 3. Budget is fine, just can't find the right people. 

Marketing spend was $400K, which is over budget by like $50K but the ROI was good so probably fine.

Oh and NPS went up to 42 from 38. Product team should feel good about that.

For next quarter... Jake wants to focus on mobile app, Lisa wants API improvements for enterprise. Need to decide. Probably mobile is the right call given the churn issue.

That's it I think. Need to make this into slides for Monday.
