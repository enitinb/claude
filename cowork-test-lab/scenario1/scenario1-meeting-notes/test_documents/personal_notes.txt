My Notes - Jan 15

Jake found the enterprise issue is just a config bug. 2-day fix vs 6-week project.

If we do quick fix, we could do mobile in Q1 instead. Lisa would be thrilled.

Problem: Sarah already told enterprise accounts we're doing a "major upgrade."
Walking that back might look bad.

I think we should do quick fix AND mobile. Best of both worlds.
