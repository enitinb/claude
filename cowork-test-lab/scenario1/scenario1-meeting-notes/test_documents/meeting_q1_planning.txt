MEETING: Q1 Planning
Date: Jan 10, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (Eng), Lisa (Design)

SARAH: We need to pick between mobile redesign or API upgrade. Only one this quarter.

MIKE: API is urgent — three enterprise accounts ($50K/month combined) threatened to leave.

LISA: But mobile NPS is 23 points lower than desktop. Users hate the app.

SARAH: How long is API fix?

MIKE: Six weeks minimum. Breaking change needs migration support.

LISA: Mobile is eight weeks but affects more users.

SARAH: Let's do API first. Can't lose enterprise accounts. Mobile goes to Q2.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Mike: Start API planning (due Jan 15)
- Lisa: Document mobile requirements for Q2 (due Jan 20)
- Sarah: Tell enterprise accounts about timeline (due Jan 12)
