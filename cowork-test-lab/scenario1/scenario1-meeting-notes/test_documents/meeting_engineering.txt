MEETING: Engineering Sync
Date: Jan 14, 2025
Attendees: Mike (Eng Lead), Jake (Backend)

MIKE: We're doing API upgrade. What's the risk?

JAKE: Big issue — current auth tokens won't work. Every customer needs new credentials.

MIKE: That'll cause support tickets.

JAKE: Also, I found the actual bug causing enterprise complaints. It's just a rate limiting config issue. Two-day fix.

MIKE: Wait — we can fix that without the full upgrade?

JAKE: Yes. Quick config change.

MIKE: That changes everything. We could do mobile instead. I need to tell Sarah.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Jake: Document the quick fix option (due Jan 15)
- Mike: Talk to Sarah today
