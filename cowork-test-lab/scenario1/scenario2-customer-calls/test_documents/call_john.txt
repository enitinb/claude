CALL: John Davis | Starter Plan ($49/mo)
Date: Jan 16, 2025

AGENT: How can I help?

JOHN: Export is broken. Trying for an hour to download my contacts.

AGENT: What error do you see?

JOHN: Times out. I only have 500 contacts.

AGENT: I see — Starter plan has 200-contact export limit. You'd need Pro for larger exports.

JOHN: That wasn't mentioned when I signed up. Not happy.

AGENT: I can do a manual export as one-time courtesy. You'll get it in 10 minutes.

NOTES: Frustrated about limits. Churn risk. Renewal: Feb 15.
