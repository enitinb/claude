**Test Cowork's ability to synthesize information across multiple documents.**

---

## Examples

| Folder | Task | Documents | Time |
|--------|------|-----------|------|
| [scenario1-meeting-notes](./scenario1-meeting-notes/) | Meeting notes → Executive summary | 3 files | ~5 min |
| [scenario2-customer-calls](./scenario2-customer-calls/) | Call transcripts → Customer insights | 4 files | ~5 min |

## What You're Testing

- Does Cowork read all documents?
- Does it connect information across files?
- Does it surface insights not explicitly stated?
